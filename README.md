# Automobile Import Price Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms

## Overview

This project aims to predict the import prices of automobiles using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains information on 201 automobile imports, with 26 columns of features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains 201 rows and 26 columns. Each row represents an automobile import, while the columns contain various features such as make, model, engine specifications, and more. 

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used

We have experimented with several machine learning algorithms to predict the import prices of automobiles:

1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
6. KNN
7. XGBoost

## Conclusion

After thorough evaluation and comparison of the performance of these algorithms, we have drawn the following conclusion:

Our machine learning model utilizing Random Forest has yielded the best performance in predicting automobile import prices, achieving an R2 score of 89.08%. This score indicates that approximately 89.08% of the variability in the target variable, the import prices of automobiles, is explained by the features included in the model.

## Future Work

In future iterations of this project, we may explore additional feature engineering techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble methods to further improve the predictive performance of our model. Additionally, collecting more data or refining existing features could potentially enhance the accuracy of the predictions.
